# Customizing containerd

## Running sandboxed containers using gVisor

For additional security in a Kubernetes cluster it can be useful to run certain
containers in a restricted runtime environment known as a sandbox. One option for this
is to use [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/) which provides a layer
of separation between a running container and the host kernel.

To use gVisor, the necessary executables and [containerd configuration](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/cri/config.md#runtime-classes) can be added
to the image generated with image-builder by setting the `containerd_gvisor_runtime`
flag to `true`. For example, in a packer configuration file:

```json
{
    "containerd_gvisor_runtime": true,
    "containerd_gvisor_version": "yyyymmdd",
}
```

This will tell image_builder to install `runsc`, the executable for gVisor, as well as
the necessary configuration for containerd. Note that `containerd_gvisor_version: yyyymmdd` can be used to install a specific 
[point release](https://github.com/google/gvisor/releases) version. The version defaults to `latest`.

Once you have built your cluster using the new image, you can then create a `RuntimeClass` object
as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  # The name the RuntimeClass will be referenced by.
  # RuntimeClass is a non-namespaced resource.
  name: gvisor
handler: gvisor
```

Now, to run a pod in the sandboxed environment you just need to specify the name of the RuntimeClass
using `runtimeClassName` in the Pod spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-sandboxed-pod
spec:
  runtimeClassName: gvisor
  containers:
    - name: sandboxed-container
      image: nginx
```

Once the pod is up and running, you can verify by using `kubectl exec` to start a shell on the
pod and run `dmesg`. If the container sandbox is running correctly you should see output similar
to the following:

```
root@sandboxed-container:/# dmesg

[    0.511752] Digging up root...

```

You are running a sandboxed container.
